# TrafficMonitor Help
### 1. How to show the CPU and memory usage?
Right click the main window and check "Show More Info". If you also need to display the CPU and memory usage in the taskbar window, right click the taskbar window and check "Show CPU and Memory Usage".
### 2. How do I set the color of each item in the taskbar window individually?
Select "Options" In the right-click menu, switch to "Taskbar Window Settings" tab, check "Specify colors for each item", and then click the color block on the right side of "Text Color " to pop up the dialog box for taskbar window color settings. <br>
If you do not check "Specify colors for each item", you can only set the uniform color for the text.
### 3. "Auto run when Windows start" dose not work
The auto run function of the program is achieved by creating the "TrafficMonitor" key in the registry path of "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run".
If you encounter the problem of auto run dose not work, please check that the registry exists, and then check the program path is correct. If you move the location of the program, the auto run will be invalid because of the program location being invalid. In this case, you only need to uncheck "Auto run when Windows start" in the option settings, and then check it on.<br>
If you set the program to run as an administrator, the auto run function will also not work. Please try to remove running as an administrator.<br>
### 4. The program pops up the "Unable to Save Settings" message box.
For V1.72 and previous versions, if this happens, the program does not have permission to write data to its directory, causing the settings data cannot be saved. In this case, move the program to another folder that has write permissions will save this problem. <br>
In V1.73 and later versions, this problem should not theoretically occur because the configuration file has been moved to the C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Roaming\TrafficMonitor directory. If this problem still occurs, try to delete the file C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Roaming\TrafficMonitor\config.ini. This file will be regenerated after it is deleted. 
### 5. The suspension window can only be displayed on the main monitor when multiple monitors are present.
By default, the suspension window cannot be moved out of the screen boundaries. If you need to move the suspension window to other monitors, please right click the suspension window, select "Other Functions", check "Allow Out of Screen Boundaries". At this time the suspension window is no longer limited to the screen, it can be also move to any monitors. <br>
If you remove the extra monitor, then the suspension window may appear outside the screen area to cause the invisible. At this time, you only need to right click the the icon in the notification area, select "Other function", uncheck "Allow Out of Screen Boundaries", the suspension window will appear in the screen area again.
### 6. The net speed value is not fully displayed.
Because the width of each character in different fonts is not the same, in some cases, it does appear the problem of the net speed value is not fully displayed. If this problem occurs, open "Options"-"Taskbar Window Settings", and select a larger value in the "Number of digits" drop down list.
### 7. How to cancel after setting the mouse penetrate?
Right click the TrafficMonitor icon in the notification area, uncheck the "Mouse Penetrate".<br>
After the mouse penetrate is set, the suspension window will not be able to respond to any mouse messages, or pop-up right-click menu. But the menu can be poped up by right click the icon in notification area. The right-click menu of the main window and which of the notification area icon is exactly the same.<br>
In addition, even if you have previously set the hidden notify icon, when the "mouse penetrate" is set, the notify icon will also automatically appear to prevent the right-click menu cannot be displayed. <br>
Note: The notification area icon will be automatically displayed in the following situations: <br>
* After the "Mouse Penetrate" is set;
* Hide the main window without displaying the taskbar window;
* Close the taskbar window when the main window is hidden;
* Close the taskbar window when the "Mouse Penetrate" is set.
### 8. The CPU usage displayed on TrafficMonitor is not accurate, which is smaller than in the task manager.
This problem exists not only in Trafficmonitor, but also in other software that has CPU usage display function. It seems to be due to the result of the CPU usage acquired by API after Windows 10 is inconsistent with whitch shown by the task Manager. <br>
